## Installation
Clone project. Run the following line of code in your terminal to install all the needed packages: npm install and npm express.
Then add folders and files:
DB: file db.json 
helpers: files fsUtils.js and uuid.js
public/assets/CSS: files styles.css
js: index.js 
routes: index.js, notes.js
Then we have index.html, notes.html, server.js, gitignore and Readme files with all the installation of the package.js and package-lock.json and node_modules.


## Usage
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
Then I can delete a note if I no longer want to have it saved

Here is a video you can see how the functionality works:
